    <p>Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error&hellip; Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won&rsquo;t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.</p>
    <p>A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the rest of the company&rsquo;s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.</li>
        <li>And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.</li>
    </ul>
